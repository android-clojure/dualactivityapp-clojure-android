# DualActivityApp

This is a Clojure/Android application. It is a simple application created for learning more about Clojure/Android. It is not intended for any practical use. 

The application investigates two things:

* How to create two activities and communicate between them.
* How to change the appearance of the app using a theme.

The main sources used to learn how to do this was:

* Android App Development with Clojure: https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/events/blob/master/tutorial.md

* Activity tutorial: https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/starting-activity.html

* Theme tutorial: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/look-and-feel/themes.html


## Usage

Setup your Clojure/Android environment according to information here: http://clojure-android.info/

If your environment is setup correctly, just build and run with:

lein droid doall
